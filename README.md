After taking a nearly 3 week sabbatical from coding - I was vacationing in India - this was my first app as soon as I got back.

The company I was interning at for the summer required us to keep (pictures of) the receipts for food-related expenses so that we could be reimbursed.

I got annoyed at how the receipts cluttered my Camera Roll/Photos, especially as they were temporary; I was going to delete all of them at the end of this summer.

So I built this app as a super simple private photos app for misc. photos that I needed to keep but don't want to see when I'm scrolling through my photos.

About half way into it, I discovered another app that did the exact same function so I decided to discontinue work on this so that I could work on more challenging/interesting projects
